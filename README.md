# Programming 3 project repository

This is the repository for implementing the course project for your group. It contains a simple JavaFX-Maven
project.

Note that your project now has several members and what you do impacts other's work.

Add the remote repository for the project material
(https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/compcs140-spring2024/group_template_project)
as a remote to your local repository to fetch possible updates to the code provided by the course.

You are allowed (and probably should) make changes to this file after you have started your project.
